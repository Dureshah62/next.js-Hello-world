# next.js-Hello-world
The Home component I've written is a functional component that renders a simple "Hello World" message.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my code:

export default function Home() { ... }:
This defines and exports a function component called Home. When this component is used, it will return the JSX inside it.
<h1>Hello World</h1>:
This is the JSX (JavaScript XML) that the component renders, which will display an H1 heading with the text "Hello World".
